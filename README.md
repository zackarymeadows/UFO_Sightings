## Room for improvement
The data regarding these sightings is very rich, which is a little daunting for those just catching up on The X-files. 
Perhaps we could also have an index of cities, states, countries, and the shape of the UFOS. This way visiors expiriencing their "first-encounters" would have a place to start.
It would also be beneficial to include a sliding scale filter to filter by duration accurately.
